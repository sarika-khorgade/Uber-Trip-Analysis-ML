# 🚖 Uber Trip Analysis & Demand Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip data to identify travel patterns and predict trip demand using machine learning techniques.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and predictive modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze trip trends by hour, day, and month
- Identify peak demand periods
- Build a machine learning model to predict trip demand
- Evaluate model performance

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- JupyterLab

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Trips by Hour
- Trips by Weekday
- Trips by Month
- Peak Demand Analysis

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
- Metrics:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Peak demand occurs during evening hours.
- Weekends show higher trip frequency.
- Demand increases during specific months.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add weather data integration
- Time-series forecasting (ARIMA / LSTM)
- Deploy as dashboard application
